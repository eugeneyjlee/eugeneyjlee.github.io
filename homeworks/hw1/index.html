    Hello everyone! I am Eugene, a freshman at UC Berkeley. I recently graduated from Chadwick International School located in Incheon, South Korea and am interested in pursuing a career in the design field after graduating from college. The three words I would use to express myself are: cheerful, determined, and consistent!

    <li>From this article, I learned the importance of critically analyzing and deconstructing the design elements of commonly used apps to develop a keen eye for design. Kathleen Warner stresses the importance of thoroughly analyzing the design elements of the apps, such as hierarchy, content, intent, and audience, in order to comprehend the designers' motivations.</li>
    <li>My favorite part of the article was the "Breaking down the app" section, where Kathleen deconstructed popular apps like Airbnb, Twitter, and Spotify. It was simpler to understand the level of thinking that goes into seemingly straightforward design decisions because to this hands-on approach, which was supported by detailed observations. It also highlighted the numerous factors that a designer must take into account.</li>
    <li>"Donâ€™t just use apps, study them."</li>
    <li>I would rate the article an 8 out of 10. I liked how the article took an instructional approach, giving readers practical tips and examples to help them develop their design intuition. The information was interesting and instructive because it offered useful guidance along with examples from real-world situations.</li>
