						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that Gestalt principles, originating from psychology, can play a critical role in the field of UI design. These principles provide designers with a robust framework to influence perception, direct attention, and elicit behavioral changes in users. The application of principles can help in grouping similar information, thereby decluttering layouts and enhancing the overall user experience.	</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the detailed breakdown of each Gestalt principle and its application in UI design. The article not only described the psychology behind each principle but also offered practical advice on how to employ them effectively. It served as both a theoretical and practical guide. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception. What happens when someone’s eye meets your design creations? How does their mind react to the message your piece is sharing?” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
