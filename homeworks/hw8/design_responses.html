						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>This article taught me that designers employ Dark Patterns to trick consumers into performing actions they did not plan, such as buying products or signing up for services. These dishonest tactics have their roots in the early years of e-commerce. The article also details many kinds of Dark Patterns, thoroughly explaining how these immoral design decisions show themselves in user interfaces.</p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>My favorite part of the article was the detailed breakdown of the different types of Dark Patterns. Using examples from everyday life helped to make the ideas more relatable and clear. This section of the article successfully increased users' understanding of the subtleties of these dishonest activities, giving them the tools to spot and avoid them.</p>

						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>“When you use the web, you don’t read every word on every page — you skim read and make assumptions. If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage of it by making a page look like it is saying one thing when in fact it is saying another.”</p>
					</li>
