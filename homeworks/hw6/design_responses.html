							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One important takeaway is the critical role that duration and speed play in the effectiveness of an animation. According to the article, the ideal speed for interface animations should lie between 200 and 500 milliseconds, as these values are tailored to the human brain's capabilities. This serves as a helpful guideline for UX designers who are looking to strike the perfect balance between capturing attention and maintaining user engagement. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The section discussing easing and the different animation curves was particularly interesting. It elaborated on how various curves, such as the "ease-in," "ease-out," and "ease-in-out," affect the naturalness and fluidity of object movement in animations. This part of the article goes beyond simple rules, offering insights into how the choice of animation curves can impact the interface's emotional resonance and perceived realism. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms. These figures are based on the particular qualities of the human brain. Any animation shorter than 100 ms is instantaneous and wonâ€™t be recognized at all. Whereas the animation longer than 1 second would convey a sense of delay and thus be boring for the user." </p>
